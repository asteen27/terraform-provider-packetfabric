## Quick Start

1. Create the file ``secret.tfvars`` and update each variables as needed.

```sh
cp secret.tfvars.sample secret.tfvars
```

2. Initialize Terraform, create an execution plan and execute the plan.

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="secret.tfvars"
```

Apply the plan:

```sh
terraform apply -var-file="secret.tfvars"
```

3. Destroy all remote objects managed by the Terraform configuration.

```sh
terraform destroy -var-file="secret.tfvars"
```
